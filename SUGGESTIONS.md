# Suggestions

### Project
whats the point of ansible files if no instructions to use are provided ?
why would i need `hosts.ini` file ?

### README
- What am i suppose to understand from this project ?
- Missing links to
  - INSTALL.md
  - TASKS.md

### SCRIPT
- Missing comments
- Missing strict check
- No management or tests are used
- why not import the static values from the /etc/os-release ?

### ANSIBLE
- ansible playbook is not working
  -  ansible vairable that is registered is not correct
  -  the debug message is not working.
- despite tasks requirements: why not use shell command in yaml with ansible `shell` module  ?
